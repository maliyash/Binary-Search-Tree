# Binary-Search-Tree
This program is an implementation of BST in Java using recursion.
It performs basic operations in a Binary Search Tree. 
1.Insertion an element in a tree. 
2.Deleting an element in a tree. 
3.Searching for a value in a tree.
4.Finding the maximum value in a tree.
5.Finding the maximum value in a tree.

Delete function is divided into four cases
(i) A leaf node (but not the root).
(ii) A non-leaf node (not the root) with only one non-null subtree.
(iii) A root node with one non-null subtree.
(iv) A node with both non-null subtrees.
